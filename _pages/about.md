I am generally interested in scientific research, while my career thus far focused in the field of computational biology/biochemistry, I am also eager to apply my skill set for problem solving within other natural sciences. My life-long secular pilgrimage is to pursue the nature of physical reality via unceasing study of spacetime, matter, energy, and their constituents.

Currently
------

2021-2024

I am a PhD student at the Physical Chemistry Curie Lab (2021-2024), an interdiscipinary research unit of the Curie Institute that uses physics to understand living matter. While my team specialises in molecular microscopy of membranes by means of in vitro reconstitution and cryo-electron microscopy, my project (see poster 'A workflow for automatic sampling of membrane proteins in subtomogram averaging' via link) is focused on the development of image processing workflows for resolving membrane protein structures by cryo-electron tomography.

Previously

2018-2021

Before I started my PhD, I was a master student at Heidelberg University, where I focused my coursework in bioinformatics and computational biology. Through research internships, I gained experience in the fields of microfluidics (synthetic biology), proteomics (cancer biology), single-cell RNA sequencing (evolution), molecular dynamics (biochemical physics), and image processing for cryo-electron tomography (virology).

2015-2018

I completed my bachelor study at University College Utrecht, an honours college of Utrecht University, where I focused on the following subjects ranked by course weight from high to low: cognitive neuroscience, chemistry, molecular cell biology, & medicine (gained pre-med qualification). Topics of my research internships in brief: therapeutic nanoparticles, development and cancer modelling in organoids.

Future
------

2024-?

I intend to pursue a postdoctoral position in fundamental scientific research after my PhD graduation. Research fields that appeal to me the most for my next step are structural studies, chemical physics, material sciences, and systems biology. I am most interested in continuing in image processing for cryo-electron microscopy/tomography. Although I am also happy to take up alternative computer vision, molecular dynamics, and/or omics based projects. I am not actively seeking industrial positions, but I would be glad to be a part of promising academic startups and companies that make positive environmental impacts.
