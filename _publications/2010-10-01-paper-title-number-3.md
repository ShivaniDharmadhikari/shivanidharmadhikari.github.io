excerpt: 'Electron microscopy has played a pivotal role in elucidating the ultrastructure of membrane contact sites between cellular organelles. The advent of cryo-electron microscopy has ushered in the ability to determine atomic models of constituent proteins or protein complexes within sites of membrane contact through single particle analysis. Furthermore, it enables the visualization of the three-dimensional architecture of membrane contact sites, encompassing numerous copies of proteins, whether in vitro reconstituted or directly observed in situ using cryo-electron tomography. Nevertheless, there exists a scarcity of cryo-electron microscopy studies focused on the site of membrane contact and their constitutive proteins. This review provides an overview of the contributions made by cryo-electron microscopy to our understanding of membrane contact sites, outlines the associated limitations, and explores prospects in this field.'
