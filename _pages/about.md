I am generally interested in scientific research, while my career thus far focused in the field of computational biology/biochemistry, I am also eager to apply my skill set for problem solving within other natural sciences. My life-long secular pilgrimage is to pursue the nature of reality through unceasing study of philosophy, mathematics, and physical sciences.

Currently
------

2021-2024

I am a PhD student at the [Physical Chemistry Curie Lab](https://institut-curie.org/unit/umr168) (2021-2024), an interdiscipinary research unit of [Institut Curie](https://curie.fr/) that uses physics to understand living matter. While [my team](https://institut-curie.org/team/levy) specialises in molecular microscopy of membranes by means of in vitro reconstitution and cryo-electron microscopy, [my project](https://docdro.id/9xqujhv) is focused on the development of image processing workflows for characterising membrane morphologies and resolving membrane protein structures by cryo-electron tomography.

Previously
------

2018-2021

Before I started my PhD, I was a master student at [Heidelberg University](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en), where I focused my coursework in bioinformatics and computational biology. Through research internships, I gained experience in the fields of microfluidics (synthetic biology), proteomics (cancer biology), single-cell RNA sequencing (evolution), molecular dynamics (biochemical physics), and image processing for cryo-electron tomography (virology).

2015-2018

I completed my bachelor study at [University College Utrecht](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/university-college-utrecht), an honours college of [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en), where I focused on the following subjects (tracks) ranked by course weight from high to low: cognitive neuroscience, chemistry, molecular cell biology, & medicine (gained pre-med qualification). Some topics of my track-finishing projects: spatial perception, brain imaging with fMRI/MRI, drug design, and plant molecular biology. Topics of my research internships: therapeutic nanoparticles, development and cancer modelling in organoids.

Future
------

2024-?

I intend to pursue a postdoctoral position in fundamental scientific research after my PhD graduation. Research fields that appeal to me the most for my next step are structural studies, chemical physics, material sciences, and systems biology. I am most interested in continuing in image processing for cryo-electron microscopy/tomography. Although I am also happy to take up alternative computer vision, molecular dynamics, and/or omics based projects. I am not actively seeking industrial positions, but I would be glad to be a part of promising academic startups and companies that make positive environmental impacts.

Hobbies
------

As a child, I practised gymnastics, learnt to play the piano, and won awards in art and creative writing competitions. I also published a short poem and obtained an official line art skill qualification. As a teen, my interests completely shifted to sciences. Instead, I won awards in Olympiad maths, innovative physics, and academic debate competitions. 

Nowadays, since my work happens to be my major hobby, I am taking it easy. I enjoy going around on my goofy kickscooter, taking care of my pet lizard and his live food, struggling to play the majestic [otamatone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I7nCZVky40) well (one day), doing [amateur landscape photography](https://www.instagram.com/cyansingjikching/?hl=en) when I travel and/or hike, going urban exploring, bouldering, and playing [DnD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons) with friends.
