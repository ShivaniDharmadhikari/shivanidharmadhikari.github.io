I am a biologist with a strong interest in the intersections of biology and physics. My expertise includes microscopy, advanced optical techniques and biophysical measurement techniques  to study the early stages of embryonic development. I thrive in interdisciplinary environments and am dedicated to uncovering fundamental processes that shape life. My future goal is to apply my research in early developmental biology.

Currently
------

2022 - Present

I am a PhD student at the Jean-Léon Maître Lab, Institut Curie, Paris. My research focuses on understanding the plasma membrane mechanics during the formation of the first mammalian epithelium in preimplantation development. This work involves the use of advanced imaging techniques, and biophysical measurements to understand developmental morphogenesis. 

Previously
------

2021 - 2022

As a project assistant at the Leptin Lab, EMBL Heidelberg, I worked on optimising optogenetic techniques to understand inflammasome formation in epithelium of the zebrafish. Overall, the study employs a combination of molecular biology techniques (genetic engineering of Opto-ASC), advanced imaging techniques (live cell imaging), histological analysis (morphological characterization), and functional assays (calcium signaling assays) to investigate the control and effects of inflammasome activation in a controlled, cell-specific manner in zebrafish

2018-2022

My master’s projects at St. Xavier’s College, Mumbai, and NABTD, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, encompassed diverse research initiatives. At St. Xavier’s College, Mumbai, I conducted studies focused on the phenolic composition of wines, exploring the antioxidant properties and chemical profiles of various wine samples. This research aimed to enhance understanding of the health benefits associated with wine consumption and contribute to the broader field of food chemistry and nutrition.

Simultaneously, at NABTD (Nuclear agricultural and biotechnology), Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Mumbai my research focused on enhancing the iron content in millet grains. I employed biochemical and molecular techniques to investigate strategies for increasing the bioavailability of iron in millet, an important staple crop in regions vulnerable to micronutrient deficiencies. This project aimed to address nutritional challenges through biofortification, contributing to efforts in agronomy and food security.

Future
------

2026 - ?

My aim is to pursue a postdoctoral position to advance our understanding of  fundamental early developmental processes in embryology.
I have developed expertise in biochemical, molecular, and advanced biophysical techniques including optogenetics, lattice light sheet imaging, optical tweezers, and live imaging. I aim to integrate these interdisciplinary approaches to study biophysical measurements in early embryology, focusing on quantifying mechanical forces, analyzing cell signaling dynamics, and understanding spatial organization within developing embryos. Ultimately, I aspire to lead a research group pioneering new techniques and addressing fundamental questions at the intersection of physics and biology.

Hobbies
------

I pursue a variety of interests that complement my professional endeavours in biology. I am an avid landscape and nature photographer, capturing the intricate beauty of nature and urban landscapes. Urban exploration allows me to observe biodiversity in diverse environments and understand the interactions between nature and urban development. Also engaging in hiking provides not only a physical challenge but also allows me to spend time in nature. I express my creativity through drawing and painting, often drawing inspiration from biological forms and natural scenery. Additionally, I love attending ballet and opera performances. Some of my favourites because of their lovely narratives, music and emotional depth of performances are ‘Giselle,’ ‘Swan Lake,’ and ‘Madam Butterfly.’ These hobbies not only enrich my personal life but also contribute to a well-rounded perspective that enhances my approach to scientific inquiry and biological research.
