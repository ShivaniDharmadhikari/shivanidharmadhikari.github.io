I am a biologist with a strong interest in the intersections of biology and physics. My expertise includes microscopy, advanced optical techniques and biophysical measurement techniques  to study the early stages of embryonic development. I thrive in interdisciplinary environments and am dedicated to uncovering fundamental processes that shape life. My future goal is to apply my research in early developmental biology.

Currently

2022 - Present

I am a PhD student at the Jean-Léon Maître Lab, Institut Curie, Paris. My research focuses on understanding the plasma membrane mechanics during the formation of the first mammalian epithelium in preimplantation development. This work involves the use of advanced imaging techniques, and biophysical measurements to understand developmental morphogenesis.

Previously

2018-2021

Before I started my PhD, I was a master student at [Heidelberg University](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en), where I focused my coursework in bioinformatics and computational biology. Through research internships, I gained experience in the fields of microfluidics (synthetic biology), proteomics (cancer biology), single-cell RNA sequencing (evolution), molecular dynamics (biochemical physics), and image processing for cryo-electron tomography (virology).

2015-2018

I completed my bachelor study at [University College Utrecht](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/university-college-utrecht), an honours college of [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en), where I focused on the following subjects (tracks) ranked by course weight from high to low: cognitive neuroscience, chemistry, molecular cell biology, & medicine (gained pre-med qualification). Some topics of my track-finishing projects: spatial perception, brain imaging with fMRI/MRI, drug design, and plant molecular biology. Topics of my research internships: therapeutic nanoparticles, development and cancer modelling in organoids.

Future
------

2025-?

I intend to pursue a postdoctoral position and eventually a professorship in fundamental scientific research after my PhD graduation. I am interested in continuing in the field of cryo-electron microscopy/tomography. I am also keen on exploring alternative computational projects in protein sciences (e.g., protein structure, function, and interaction simulation/prediction, and protein design), abiogenesis, molecular paleontology/evolution, and image/signal processing (for applications in neuroscience, geoscience, astronomy and/or others). I am not actively seeking industrial positions, but I would be glad to be a part of promising academic startups and companies that make positive environmental impacts.

Hobbies
------

As a child, I practised gymnastics, learnt to play the piano, won awards in art and creative writing competitions. I also published writing pieces and obtained an official line art skill qualification. As a teen, my interests completely shifted to sciences. Instead, I won awards in Olympiad maths, innovative physics, and academic debate competitions. 

Nowadays, since my work happens to be my major hobby, I am taking it easy. I enjoy going around on my goofy kickscooter, taking care of my pet lizard and his live food, struggling to play the majestic [otamatone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I7nCZVky40) well (one day), doing [amateur landscape photography](https://www.instagram.com/cyansingjikching/?hl=en) when I travel and/or hike, going urban exploring, bouldering, and playing [DnD or games alike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons) with friends, I dungeon master.
