Education
------
* BSc with distinction: cum laude, awarded by [University College Utrecht](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/university-college-utrecht), the honours college of [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en) in 2018.

Completed Cognitive Neuroscience (1), Chemistry (2), Molecular Cell Biology (2), and Medicine (3) tracks (number indicates course weight rank). Gained the '[Pre-Med](https://students.uu.nl/en/university-college-utrecht/academics/science/medical-science)' qualification recognised by research medical doctor master programmes in the Netherlands.

* MSc with distinction: cum laude, awarded by the [Molecular Biosciences](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en/study/all-subjects/molecular-biosciences/molecular-biosciences-master) programme at [Heidelberg University](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en) in 2021.

Focused in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology.

* PhD degree to be awarded by [PSL Research University](https://psl.eu/en), expected in 2024.

Project focused on the development of image-processing workflows for resolving membrane protein molecular structures from cryo-electron tomography data.

Funded by the [EuReCa international PhD programme](https://training.institut-curie.org/eureca) supported by the [European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-2020_en) programme, [Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/) fellow. 

Member of [l’école doctorale Complexité du Vivant](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/ecoles-doctorales/complexite-du-vivant), [Sorbonne University](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en).
