Trainer of the one-week (6-10th of November, 2023) practical course: Image Processing for Electron Microscopy focused on (Cryo-)Tomography ([IPEMtomo](https://research.pasteur.fr/en/course/image-processing-for-electron-microscopy-tomography/)). This course aims to inform basic concepts in image processing for cryo-electron tomography, and help students gain practical experience in tomographic reconstruction (e.g., processing of low-dose tilt series with and without fiducials for 3D volume annotation or subtomogram averaging). An introduction to subtomogram averaging and initial model generation steps will also be covered. We welcome PhD students, post-doctoral fellows, engineers, and researchers to [register](https://forms.pasteur.fr/index.php/865442?lang=fr) by the 30th of September. A maximum of 12 participants will be selected. Applicants who already have tilt-series for processing will be prioritized.
